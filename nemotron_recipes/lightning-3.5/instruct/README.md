# Instruct model recipes

Recipes for `nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3.5-Lightning-30B-A3B-BF16`. Most benchmarks ship as
a Gym recipe in [`gym/`](./gym/): a script that wraps `gym eval run` with the settings
the published run used. Terminal-Bench and the two SWE-bench suites are NeMo Evaluator
configs in [`nemo-evaluator/`](./nemo-evaluator/) — see
[that section](#nemo-evaluator-recipes) below.

To run a Gym recipe, copy the two templates, fill them in, and run from the Gym repo root:

```bash
cp nemotron_recipes/lightning-3.5/instruct/gym/env.yaml.example env.yaml   # policy endpoint and judges
cp nemotron_recipes/lightning-3.5/instruct/gym/.env.example .env           # keys and paths
set -a; source .env; set +a
nemotron_recipes/lightning-3.5/instruct/gym/gpqa.sh
```

Run from the repo root, not from this directory: each recipe resolves its dataset and
prepare script relative to your working directory.

Every recipe accepts `LIMIT` for a quick smoke, `OUT` for the output directory,
`PARALLEL` for concurrency and `RESUME` to continue an interrupted run. Results land in
`./results/<benchmark>`.

Each recipe first rolls the repo back to the Gym commit its tech report number was
produced with, leaving the recipes alone. It overwrites and deletes tracked files, so
commit or stash your work first; `git restore .` puts everything back. Set `PIN_GYM=0`
to run against your current checkout instead.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.13.14 or newer**
- **[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) on your `PATH`** — Gym
  builds every server's virtualenv with it, so nothing starts without it.
- **Gym installed**, from the repo root:

  ```bash
  uv venv --python 3.13.14 && source .venv/bin/activate
  uv sync
  ```

## Serving the model

Reproducing these numbers depends on the model being served the right way. Check the
[model card](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3.5-Lightning-30B-A3B-BF16)
for the authoritative serving guidance; the command below is what these recipes were
validated with, on `vllm/vllm-openai:v0.26.0`.

```bash
vllm serve nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3.5-Lightning-30B-A3B-BF16 \
  --served-model-name nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3.5-Lightning-30B-A3B-BF16 --port 8000 \
  --tensor-parallel-size 2 --pipeline-parallel-size 1 --data-parallel-size 2 \
  --data-parallel-backend ray --data-parallel-size-local 2 --api-server-count 1 \
  --trust-remote-code --gpu-memory-utilization 0.85 \
  --enable-prefix-caching --enable-chunked-prefill \
  --enable-auto-tool-choice --tool-call-parser qwen3_coder \
  --reasoning-parser nemotron_v3 \
  --kv-cache-dtype fp8 --mamba-cache-mode align \
  --max-num-batched-tokens 131072 \
  --model-loader-extra-config '{"enable_multithread_load": true, "num_threads": 96}'
```

The NeMo Evaluator recipes were served with `--gpu-memory-utilization 0.95`,
`--max-num-seqs 32` and an explicit `--max-model-len 262144` instead of
`--max-num-batched-tokens` — throughput knobs rather than output ones, so one endpoint
serves every recipe here.

## Benchmarks needing extra setup

Most recipes need nothing beyond the prerequisites above. These do:

### SciCode

Scoring needs `test_data.h5` (~1 GB) — the numeric ground-truth the test cases are
checked against. It is not downloaded automatically. Get it from the official SciCode
[Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1W5GZW6_bdiDAiipuFMqdUhvUaHIj6-pR),
save it anywhere, and point `TEST_DATA` at it:

```bash
sha256sum /path/to/test_data.h5
# 48b0272a88b17dbd29777c217e1b4fb2b019b92e11cc2add847409db9541b890

TEST_DATA=/path/to/test_data.h5 nemotron_recipes/lightning-3.5/instruct/gym/scicode.sh
```

It must be readable by the user running the recipe — otherwise every test case fails
and the run scores 0 with no error.

### GDPval

The agent writes real work products (spreadsheets, documents, code output) and runs
its code inside an Apptainer sandbox. Three things must exist before a run.

**1. The sandbox.** The definition ships with Gym; build the image once:

```bash
nemotron_recipes/lightning-3.5/instruct/gym/gdpval/build-gdpval-sif.sh /abs/path/gdpval.sif
export GDPVAL_CONTAINER_PATH=/abs/path/gdpval.sif
```

You do **not** need to install the document-generation stack yourself. The agent writes
deliverables inside the sandbox, and the image already carries LibreOffice plus
`python-docx`, `python-pptx`, `openpyxl`, `fpdf2`, `reportlab`, `weasyprint` and the
rest.

**2. Root.** The sandbox is started with `--home /root`, which an ordinary user cannot
enter. Office deliverables are also converted to PDF on the host — not in the sandbox —
and the resources server prepares LibreOffice on startup by running:

```bash
apt-get install -y libreoffice fonts-liberation default-jre-headless libreoffice-java-common
```

That call needs root and returns early if it fails, so pre-installing the packages
doesn't substitute. Either way the run still exits 0: if the sandbox cannot start no
task runs at all, and if only the conversion fails the deliverables reach the judge
unconverted and score lower. Run as root, or in a container where you are.

**3. A judge endpoint serving all three panel models.** Deliverables are graded by a
panel — GPT-5.5, Gemini 3.1 Pro and Claude Opus 4.8, one sampled per call — all routed
through the `gdpval_judge_model` block in `env.yaml`, so one endpoint has to serve all
three.

For a full run give `TAVILY_API_KEY` several keys — `'[tvly-1,tvly-2]'` — since a single
key rate-limits and the agent then cannot search.

#### Rubric mode (default)

A judge scores each deliverable against its task rubric.

```bash
nemotron_recipes/lightning-3.5/instruct/gym/gdpval/gdpval.sh
```

#### Comparison mode

Scores deliverables pairwise against reference models **you generate yourself**. Point
`GDPVAL_REFS` at a directory holding one subdirectory per reference, named after the
model:

```
refs/
  gptoss_120b/        task_<id>/repeat_0/...
  gemma4_26b/         task_<id>/repeat_0/...
```

Produce each one with an execute-only run of that model — point the policy in
`env.yaml` at it, then:

```bash
EXECUTE_ONLY=true OUT=./tmp nemotron_recipes/lightning-3.5/instruct/gym/gdpval/gdpval.sh && mv ./tmp/deliverables ./refs/gptoss_120b
```

Then score your model against whatever you collected:

```bash
GDPVAL_REWARD_MODE=comparison GDPVAL_REFS=./refs nemotron_recipes/lightning-3.5/instruct/gym/gdpval/gdpval.sh
```

The recipe recognises these names and anchors each at the
[Artificial Analysis GDPval-AA v2](https://artificialanalysis.ai/evaluations/gdpval-aa)
rating the published figures were fitted against. The live board has moved since, so
these deliberately no longer match it:

| Reference | ELO | | Reference | ELO |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `deepseek_v4_pro` | 1307 | | `qwen35_397b` | 962 |
| `glm51_fp8` | 1257 | | `gptoss_120b` | 799 |
| `kimi_k26` | 1191 | | `gemma4_26b` | 761 |
| `nemotron3_ultra` | 1164 | | `qwen3_30b_thinking` | 308 |
| `qwen36_35b` | 1049 | | | |

Supply **two or more** and the run switches to the two-stage fit used for the published
numbers: a 45-task pass over all of them to place the model, then the full task set
against the four nearest. Supply all nine and the method matches the reference run.

`JUDGE_ONLY=true` re-scores deliverables you already have, and needs neither the
sandbox nor a search key.

One caveat on `RESUME`: a stage is journalled complete once it finishes, whether or not
any rollout in it succeeded, and a resume then skips it for good. If a stage produces
zero rollouts — an endpoint that was down the whole time, a bad key — delete
`evaluator_rollouts_multistage_state.jsonl` from `OUT` before resuming, or that stage
contributes nothing to the fit and the ELO comes out wrong with no error. Only at zero;
a stage that partly succeeded resumes correctly.

#### Reproducing our numbers

We ran comparison mode: deliverables judged against all nine reference models above,
fitted in two stages, graded by the three-judge panel. The scale is Artificial Analysis'
GDPval-AA v2 ELO, anchored to a human baseline of 1000 — so roughly 1000 is human-level
on these tasks.

The closest you can get is to generate those nine reference sets yourself and run the
same way: same method, same anchors, same scale. It will land near our number rather
than on it — a gap of tens of points is noise here, not a regression.

That is also the expensive path: nine reference sets means nine full 220-task agentic
runs before you score your own. Rubric mode is one run and no references. It gives a
self-contained score rather than an ELO, which is enough if you are comparing your own
runs rather than positioning against published models.

### PinchBench

Each task runs in its own sandbox, built from the image definition that ships with Gym.
Build it once — this needs **Docker**, because the Apptainer path converts a Docker
image rather than building directly:

```bash
export PINCHBENCH_SIF=/abs/path/pinchbench.sif
bash responses_api_agents/pinchbench/setup_scripts/build_image.sh --apptainer
```

The build script writes to `PINCHBENCH_SIF` when it is set, so exporting it first points
both the build and the recipe at the same file.

On a host without Docker, build the image elsewhere and copy the `.sif` across.

The policy endpoint is given to the recipe directly rather than through `env.yaml`,
because OpenClaw calls it itself: set `PINCHBENCH_MODEL_BASE_URL`,
`PINCHBENCH_MODEL_API_KEY` and `PINCHBENCH_MODEL_NAME` alongside the judge and search
keys — all listed in `.env.example`.

### CritPt

The Artificial Analysis API scores in batches of exactly 70 distinct problems, so a full
run — 70 problems repeated five times — costs five scoring calls.

That shapes three things. `LIMIT` counts rollouts and repeats are grouped, so a limited
run never gathers 70 different problems and is never scored. Each key carries a daily scoring quota
and rotates only once a key is rate-limited, so pass several to get through all five calls:
`ARTIFICIAL_ANALYSIS_API_KEY='[key-1,key-2]'`. And concurrency should stay at its default
of 350, since a rollout waiting to be scored holds its slot — lower values starve the
batches and the run wedges until it times out.

If 350 is more than your endpoint can take, five single-repeat runs at 70 give the same
result. Average their `mean/reward`:

```bash
for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do
  CRITPT_REPEATS=1 PARALLEL=70 OUT=./results/critpt/run_$i nemotron_recipes/lightning-3.5/instruct/gym/critpt.sh
done
```

Every submission and grader response is cached under `<OUT>/critpt_cache`. If a run dies
on quota, re-score it once the quota resets without repeating any inference:

```bash
python -m resources_servers.critpt.replay --cache-dir <OUT>/critpt_cache
```

## NeMo Evaluator recipes

Terminal-Bench 2.1, SWE-bench Verified and SWE-bench Multilingual are still being migrated
to Gym and for now still belong to
[NeMo Evaluator](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Evaluator). Until that migration lands
they are published here as YAML configs in [`nemo-evaluator/`](./nemo-evaluator/) and are
run with `nel eval run` rather than as Gym recipes.

Two things have to be in place first.

**1. NeMo Evaluator, pinned to the commit these numbers were produced with.**

```bash
pip install "nemo-evaluator[harbor] @ git+https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Evaluator.git@230c8411fff82fa581195b7d088d7fb67d3bc98c"
```

Do not use the 0.3.0 release on PyPI: it does not recognise `sandbox.scrub_git_history`,
which the SWE-bench Multilingual config sets, and refuses to load the file. Do not delete
that line to silence the error either — it strips each task repository's later commits,
and without it the agent can read the official fix straight out of the git history and
score far too high.

**2. An AWS sandbox.** Every task runs in its own ECS Fargate container, and that
infrastructure is not created for you. Apply the reference Terraform stack from the
[NeMo Evaluator repository](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Evaluator/tree/main/terraform)
in your own AWS account, in the region you plan to run in, then point
`sandbox.ecr_repository` in the config at that account's harbor ECR. Export
`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` next to `POLICY_API_KEY`.

Then run whichever config you want, adding `--resume` to continue an interrupted run:

```bash
nel eval run nemotron_recipes/lightning-3.5/instruct/nemo-evaluator/terminal-bench-2.1.yaml
```
