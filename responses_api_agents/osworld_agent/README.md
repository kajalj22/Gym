# OSWorld Responses API Agent

The OSWorld agent runs complete desktop-computer tasks through NeMo Gym. The
agent and benchmark stay in the Gym process; only the OSWorld desktop
container/VM lifecycle moves into Gym Docker Sandbox. Each `/run` request
creates an OSWorld `DesktopEnv`, sends observations to the configured model,
parses and executes actions, invokes OSWorld's inline evaluator, and returns
the trajectory and reward in Gym's Responses API shape.

This directory owns the reusable runtime. Dataset preparation, benchmark
configuration, model-specific overlays, serving recipes, and the full user
guide live in the [OSWorld benchmark](../../benchmarks/osworld/README.md).

## Request and response contract

The rollout collector sends the complete upstream task under
`verifier_metadata.osworld_task`. The runtime passes that task to
`DesktopEnv.reset(task_config=...)` without translating its setup or evaluator
semantics. `responses_create_params` supplies per-rollout sampling overrides.

A completed response includes:

- Gym `reward`, using binary or raw OSWorld reward according to `reward_mode`;
- `mask_sample`, set for infrastructure failures, timeouts, and unfinished
  rollouts whose reward is not suitable for training;
- `verifier_metadata.osworld_score`, `osworld_steps`, completion/error state,
  termination reason, model identity, artifact directory, and proxy provenance;
- one assistant output item per executed model step.

OSWorld continues to evaluate inside `env.evaluate()`. The environment backend
is selectable between OSWorld's provider directly and Gym Sandbox. In the
Sandbox path, OSWorld still owns `DesktopEnv`, setup, controllers, actions,
and evaluators; Gym Sandbox owns only the VM container lifecycle, dynamic
service endpoints, status, and cleanup.

## Runtime components

| File | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `app.py` | Gym server, request validation, model transport, Ray dispatch, response and aggregate metrics |
| `client.py` | `DesktopEnv` lifecycle, cache staging, action execution, evaluation, logging, and artifacts |
| `runner_registry.py` | Runner names, upstream class paths, and default observation/action contracts |
| `adapter_agents.py` | Gym-owned model scaffolds, including `NemotronV3NanoOmniAgent` |
| `action_parser.py` | Gym pyautogui/control-action parsing and validation |
| `proxy.py` | Explicit proxy-task configuration validation and non-secret provenance |
| `runtime_dependencies.py` | Version/import readiness check and explicit-install remediation for excluded packages |
| `sandbox_desktop_env.py` | Scoped `DesktopEnv` compatibility wiring for the Gym Sandbox backend |
| `sandbox_provider.py` | OSWorld provider contract backed by Gym Sandbox lifecycle and endpoints |

The runtime uses a pinned, unmodified OSWorld dependency. Compatibility code
is opt-in or narrowly scoped in the Gym adapter rather than patched into the
OSWorld checkout.

## Supported runners

`runner_name` selects the model-facing scaffold:

| Runner | Ownership and contract |
| --- | --- |
| `gym_pyautogui` | Gym prompt and Python/pyautogui actions |
| `prompt_agent` and `prompt_agent_*` | Upstream OSWorld `PromptAgent` observation/action variants |
| `pointer_agent` | Upstream PointerAgent planner/executor/verifier loop |
| `m3_agent` | Upstream MiniMax M3 scaffold and protocol |
| `nemotron_v3_nano_omni_agent` | Gym-owned Nemotron 3 Nano Omni scaffold and parser |
| `qwen3_omni_agent` | Upstream Qwen3VL scaffold through Gym model transport |

The benchmark directory contains the model- and runner-specific YAML overlays.
Those examples do not change the generic runtime defaults in this directory.

### Nemotron response contract

The adapter-owned Nemotron parser requires an explicit `## Code` section, so
it never executes an unrelated code block from prose. `## Thought`,
`## Action`, and `## Code` values may begin on the heading line or the next
line, and Code may be fenced or unfenced. Thought and Action are descriptive
metadata; an explicit, syntactically valid Code section remains executable even
when an Action description is absent. Python is syntax-checked before OSWorld
executes it, and terminal actions require an explicit `success` or `failure`
status.

The current model response must contain Code, but maintained conversation
history deliberately retains only Thought and Action. Thinking-mode assistant
history preserves the model's `<think>...</think>` wrapper. Omitting previously
executed Code matches the validated Nano Omni prompt contract and avoids sending
the same executable payload twice; this behavior is part of the standard
`NemotronV3NanoOmniAgent`, not a run-local subclass or import overlay.

When adding or upgrading a model, capture representative lossless responses
and add focused parser regressions for heading placement, fenced and unfenced
Code, literal newline escaping, reasoning/content separation, tool calls, and
terminal status syntax. Supported formats should remain explicit rather than
recovering executable code from arbitrary prose.

### PromptAgent variants

The registered upstream PromptAgent variants are:

- `prompt_agent_screenshot_pyautogui`
- `prompt_agent_computer_13`
- `prompt_agent_a11y_tree_pyautogui`
- `prompt_agent_a11y_tree_computer_13`
- `prompt_agent_screenshot_a11y_tree_pyautogui`
- `prompt_agent_screenshot_a11y_tree_computer_13`
- `prompt_agent_som_pyautogui`

Runners that need accessibility data enable it when constructing `DesktopEnv`.
Reasoning wrapped in `<think>` or `<thinking>` is removed before actions are
executed.

## Configuration

The base configuration is
[`configs/osworld_agent.yaml`](configs/osworld_agent.yaml). Important fields
are grouped below.

Environment and execution:

- `provider_name`, `container_image`, `headless`, `screen_width`, and
  `screen_height` configure `DesktopEnv`.
- `sandbox_provider` selects a named Gym Sandbox provider configuration;
  `sandbox_spec` supplies the provider-neutral image/resources/entrypoint, and
  `sandbox_vm_path` selects the read-only OSWorld qcow2 base.
- `sandbox_require_kvm`, `sandbox_ready_timeout_s`, and
  `sandbox_ready_poll_s` control the OSWorld Sandbox startup gate.
- `concurrency` limits simultaneous `/run` requests.
- `max_steps`, `sleep_after_execution`, `step_timeout`, and `task_timeout`
  bound rollout work.
- `cache_dir` is OSWorld's mutable per-run cache; `setup_cache_dir` points to
  the read-only cache populated by benchmark preparation.

Runner and model behavior:

- `runner_name`, `action_space`, and `observation_type` select a registered
  runner contract.
- `env_class_path` and `agent_class_path` allow explicit compatible classes.
- `agent_kwargs` supplies runner-specific constructor options.
- `max_tokens`, `temperature`, and `top_p` provide server defaults; request
  values can override sampling parameters.

Evaluation and operations:

- `reward_mode` is `binary` or `raw`; aggregate metrics always report both
  binary success and raw OSWorld reward rates.
- `evaluator_disable_gpu` prevents evaluator helpers from reserving rollout
  GPU memory.
- `enable_proxy` and `proxy_config_file` apply only to tasks explicitly marked
  `proxy: true`.
- `asset_input_jsonl` lets server startup idempotently fill missing prepared
  assets before accepting work.

See the benchmark guide for complete field semantics, logging controls, model
recipes, VM requirements, and troubleshooting.

## Running the benchmark

The current Gym CLI commands are:

```bash
cd benchmarks/osworld
python3 prepare.py \
  --execution-backend gym_sandbox \
  --vm-path /absolute/path/to/Ubuntu.qcow2

# Explicitly opt in to packages excluded from Gym's shipped environments.
# prepare.py prints these commands with the exact configured venv path.
gym env prefetch
bash ../../responses_api_agents/osworld_agent/install_optional_runtime_deps.sh \
  ../../responses_api_agents/osworld_agent/.venv

# Terminal 1: start configured servers.
gym env start

# Terminal 2: collect against those running servers.
gym eval run --no-serve
```

The installer targets only the managed OSWorld agent venv. It does not modify
the system Python, Gym's root venv, the model server, or the OSWorld VM. The
public `benchmarks/osworld/tools/start_control.sh` wrapper checks that the
required package versions are importable and fails with the exact setup
commands when this explicit step has been omitted. The agent entrypoint repeats
that non-mutating check so a direct `gym env start` also fails early and
actionably; neither path installs packages automatically.

Choose a model-specific agent composition during preparation. For example:

```bash
python3 prepare.py \
  --profile pointer \
  --execution-backend gym_sandbox \
  --vm-path /absolute/path/to/Ubuntu.qcow2 \
  --policy-base-url https://ANTHROPIC_COMPATIBLE_HOST/v1 \
  --policy-model-name SERVED_OPUS_4_7_MODEL
```

The Docker backend mounts that base as read-only `/System.qcow2`. Reset means
destroying the Sandbox container and recreating it from the base, matching
OSWorld's Docker-provider behavior. Live RAM/device-state snapshots are not
implemented; callers that require them must select a virtualization provider
with an explicit live-snapshot API.

For data selection, host setup, advanced launchers, model-specific examples,
and expected outputs, use the [benchmark README](../../benchmarks/osworld/README.md).
