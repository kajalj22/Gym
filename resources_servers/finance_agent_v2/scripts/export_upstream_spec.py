"""Snapshot the upstream Vals prompts and tool schemas into the benchmark directory.

`benchmarks/finance_agent_v2/prepare.py` bakes the upstream system/question prompts
and tool JSON schemas into every sample, but cannot import `finance_agent` to get
them: that package is installed only in this server's venv, while `gym eval prepare`
imports the prepare script into the root `gym` process.

So the schemas are still derived from the upstream `Tool` classes, just here at export
time instead of there at prepare time. `tests/test_upstream_spec.py` re-runs this
builder against the installed package and fails if the committed file has drifted.

The upstream commit is read from the `finance-agent` pin in requirements.txt, so
bumping that pin requires re-running this; prepare.py refuses to run when its
`_UPSTREAM_SHA` and the snapshot disagree.

Usage (from the resource server venv):
