# Description
This is a resources server that is to be used to verify a single action taken by an agent that can either call a tool or send a chat message to the user as the next step in a trajectory.  For each verification request, there is an expected action that is either a tool call or a chat message.  An expected tool call is compared with a tool call issued by the agent by programmatically comparing the arguments in the tool calls.  If the expected action is a chat message, then the agent receives a positive reward if it sends a chat message, and a negative reward if it calls a tool instead.

# Parallel tool calls

## Authoring a parallel row: you must write the expectation as a batch

To verify several tool calls in one step, the dataset row **must** set `expected_action.type` to `function_call_batch` and list them under `calls`. This is not inferred — `type` is a required discriminator, and a row written as a plain `function_call` is only ever checked for that one call, no matter how many the model emits.

```jsonc
// expects three parallel calls in a single turn
"expected_action": {
  "type": "function_call_batch",
  "calls": [
    {"type": "function_call", "name": "get_weather", "arguments": "{\"city\": \"Paris\"}"},
    {"type": "function_call", "name": "get_weather", "arguments": "{\"city\": \"Tokyo\"}"},
    {"type": "function_call", "name": "get_weather", "arguments": "{\"city\": \"Cairo\"}"}
  ]
}
```

The `calls` entries are exactly the `function_call` objects a single-call row uses, so an existing row is converted by wrapping it in a batch. A batch of one call is legal and behaves like the single-call row it came from.

**The response side needs nothing.** You never author the actual side: `extract_action` collects every `function_call` item in the model's response and builds the batch itself, so a model emitting N calls is compared as a set automatically.

## Matching

The verifier matches parallel tool calls as an unordered multiset, so response output order does not matter. Because argument matching is fuzzy, one actual call can satisfy several expected calls; the verifier resolves this with a maximum bipartite matching rather than pairing calls greedily.

## `parallel_tool_call_rewarding`: the master switch

`tool_call_comparator_config.parallel_tool_call_rewarding` decides whether the **number** of tool calls a response makes affects its reward. It defaults to `false`.

While it is off, the call count is not part of the verdict at all: a response is asked only whether it made the expected call(s), and surplus calls cost nothing. This is exactly how the server behaved before parallel tool-call support existed, so **every pre-existing dataset scores identically whether or not this feature is merged**. It is also the honest default — chat templates do not render differently for `parallel_tool_calls` (the Nemotron template never references the flag), so a model is never told how many calls it may make, and charging it for an extra call would penalize behaviour it had no signal to avoid.

Turn it on for datasets that use `function_call_batch`. The two stages below are only consulted when it is on.

## Cardinality gate: which responses are admissible

`allow_subset` admits responses that make **fewer** calls than expected, and `allow_superset` admits responses that make **more**. Both default to `false`, so the call count must match exactly and anything else scores zero.

## Reward mode: how much credit an admissible response earns

`parallel_tool_call_reward_mode` accepts:

| Mode | Reward |
| --- | --- |
| `binary_strict` (default) | `1.0` only if every required call matched, else `0.0` |
| `fractional` | the matched fraction of the required calls |
| `f1` | `2 * matched / (expected + actual)` — the harmonic mean of precision and recall |

The two stages are complementary. Under `binary_strict` and `fractional` the gate is a *free pass*: once a shape is admitted, surplus calls cost nothing and `allow_subset` lets a response earn full credit for emitting only the easiest call. Concretely, with `allow_superset: true` a response that makes both expected calls plus twenty junk calls still scores `1.0`.

Under `f1` the gate instead decides which imperfect shapes are worth *partial* credit, and missing and surplus calls are penalized symmetrically — the same twenty-junk-call response scores `2 * 2 / (2 + 22) = 0.167`. Only an exact set of calls reaches `1.0`. Prefer `f1` for RL, where the permissive gates are otherwise reward-hacking vectors.

# Example usage

## Running servers
The following command can be used to run this resources server, along with the tool simulation agent and an OpenAI model:
```bash
gym env start \
    --resources-server single_step_tool_use_with_argument_comparison \
    --model-type openai_model
```

Then, rollouts can be collected using a command such as the following:
```bash
gym eval run --no-serve \
    --agent single_step_tool_use_with_argument_comparison_agent \
    --input resources_servers/single_step_tool_use_with_argument_comparison/data/example.jsonl \
    --output resources_servers/single_step_tool_use_with_argument_comparison/data/example_rollouts.jsonl
```
